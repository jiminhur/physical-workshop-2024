    Introduction
Road markings play a crucial role in providing essential visual information to drivers and pedestrians. Effective communication through these markings hinges on two primary attributes: legibility and readability. Legibility pertains to the ease with which text can be read, while readability concerns the clarity with which objects can be recognized. These concepts are fundamental to the successful transmission of visual information and extend into the realm of philosophical inquiry. This paper aims to explore the legibility of road markings through the lens of existentialism and ontology, emphasizing the critical role of perspective in interpreting visual information.

Connecting Legibility and Ontological Inquiry
The notion of legibility transcends the mere delivery of information, evolving into a subject of philosophical exploration. From an ontological standpoint, legibility involves the creation of meaning at the intersection of perceptibility and imperceptibility. Imperceptibility denotes a state in which objects are not clearly apprehended, compelling individuals to speculate about their nature. This speculative process generates new meanings, aligning closely with the themes of existential and ontological inquiry.

Existentialism and Ontology
In the ontological framework, the perception of objects occurs at the boundary between existence and non-existence. Existentialist philosophers posit that humans are incessantly engaged in the search for meaning within this boundary, particularly amid uncertainty. This uncertainty prompts speculation and interpretation, leading to the continuous creation of new meanings. This dynamic, often described as 'being in nothingness,' illustrates that meaning persists and evolves even in ostensibly non-existent states.

Case Study: Enhancing the Legibility of Road Markings
Design strategies aimed at improving the legibility of road markings can take various forms. For instance, in the context of Korean road markings, standardizing the thickness of the lines that constitute letters can significantly enhance legibility. This approach not only influences the perception of letters from different angles but also facilitates object recognition. Such design interventions extend beyond simple visual information transmission, engaging with ontological exploration through the prism of legibility.

The Importance of Perspective: Philosophical and Existential Inquiry
Differences in perspective fundamentally shape how we perceive and interpret objects and phenomena. Depending on the perspective, the same object can be perceived in disparate ways, highlighting the intrinsic differences between existence and perception. Consider the 2004 Athens Olympics, where marathon runner Vanderlei de Lima was poised to win until an intruder disrupted the race, resulting in Lima finishing third. Media coverage of the incident was largely negative, focusing on the disruption. However, the public’s perspective, influenced by Lima's smile at the finish, was more positive. This disparity underscores the absence of a singular 'correct' interpretation, with perspectives shaping our understanding and outcomes.

Changing Perspectives: Metacognition and Cognitive Errors
Humans have a tendency to conflate familiarity with correctness, a phenomenon linked to metacognitive errors. Familiarity often masquerades as correctness, leading to erroneous judgments. For example, when asked which English words are more common, many people incorrectly choose words ending in 'ing' due to their familiarity, despite other endings being more frequent. Overcoming such errors necessitates deliberate practice in shifting perspectives.

Photography and Art: Walter Benjamin's Theory of Photography
Photography offers a unique medium to capture details that often escape daily perception, thereby providing novel visual experiences. Walter Benjamin argued that photography dismantles the traditional aura of art, exposing overlooked aspects within societal structures. This role of photography is vital in expanding and challenging existing perceptual frameworks, offering new visual experiences that transcend conventional modes of seeing.

Existentialism and Aesthetics: Analyzing Artworks
Jenny Holzer's Work: Jenny Holzer projects text onto building exteriors using beam projectors, exploring the interplay between space and text. This technique compels viewers to perceive text differently through spatial contexts, presenting new perspectives.

Joseph Kosuth's Work: Joseph Kosuth's "One and Three Chairs" questions the essence of a chair through the juxtaposition of an object, an image, and a text. This piece exemplifies conceptual art, probing into notions of absence and space.

Tony Oursler's Work: Tony Oursler creates digital portraits using mechanical lenses, presenting familiar objects in novel ways. This exploration of existence and perception aligns with the themes discussed in this study.

Interview: 《Space Reading: Visual Experiment》 Project
Interviewer (I): Hello. Today, we have with us the creator of the 《Space Reading: Visual Experiment》 project. Could you first explain the basic concept and purpose of this project?

Artist (H): Hello. 《Space Reading: Visual Experiment》, also known as "Reading Method Experiment Collection" in Korean, is a project that explores how letters can be perceived differently depending on their relationship with space. This work experiments with reconfiguring the same letters in various spatial arrangements and angles to make them visually intriguing. Ultimately, the book is a collective record of these experiments.

I: That's fascinating. What motivated you to start this project?

H: The project began with an exploration of the theme of 'absence.' In everyday life, we visually perceive and interpret a lot of information. However, some subjects exist in a state that is difficult to perceive, a state of low legibility. I wanted to explore how we create new meanings through these hard-to-perceive states. Even when we cannot clearly understand a subject, countless guesses and interpretations arise from that uncertainty. I found this continuous generation of new meanings very interesting.

I: The idea that new meanings are generated in a state of low legibility is intriguing. Could you elaborate on this?

H: Certainly. A state of low legibility means we cannot clearly grasp the subject. In this state, we start to guess the meaning. For example, when we see a blurry image or unclear text, we imagine various possibilities to understand its meaning. In this process of imagination and guessing, new meanings are generated. This process can be seen as 'presence in absence.' Even in seemingly non-existent states, meanings continue to be created and transformed. I wanted to visually explore this process.

I: How do you specifically carry out this work?

H: The methods are quite diverse. I create new forms by sprinkling water to reveal patterns on surfaces or analyze the results of light passing through various surfaces. I also use different angles to present letters in new ways. Through these various visual experiments, I explore how letters are perceived differently in space. Space is not just a background but a crucial element that forms context, helping us understand and experience the boundaries of letter recognition.

I: What are your thoughts on the theme of space?

H: Space is not merely a physical location but a crucial element that forms context. By exploring how letters interact with space, we can understand and experience that context. I started this work to explore this concept of space. Space generates various meanings at the boundaries where letters can be recognized. Through this project, which began with an exploration of 'absence,' I focus on discovering new interpretations and meanings through the interaction between letters, space, and cognition.

Conclusion
Legibility, beyond being a mere vehicle for information transmission, serves as a pivotal concept in philosophical and existential inquiry. Variations in perspective can fundamentally alter our perception and interpretation of objects and phenomena. The design approach to enhance the legibility of road markings exemplifies this philosophical inquiry, exploring the boundaries between existence and non-existence. This research unveils new possibilities for visual and philosophical exploration, illustrating that new meanings are continually generated through shifts in perception and interpretation. The continuous interaction between legibility, perspective, and ontological inquiry invites us to re-evaluate our understanding of visibility and meaning in both practical and philosophical contexts.
